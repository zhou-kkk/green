                                <li><strong>Switch to LED bulbs:</strong> They use 75% less energy than incandescent
                                    bulbs and last 25 times longer. Replace your most-used lights first for maximum
                                    impact.</li>
                                <li><strong>Unplug electronics:</strong> Devices on standby mode still consume energy.
                                    Use power strips to easily turn off multiple devices, potentially saving $100+
                                    annually.</li>
                                <li><strong>Optimize your thermostat:</strong> Lower heating by 1¬∞C (2¬∞F) in winter and
                                    raise cooling by the same in summer. Install a programmable thermostat to
                                    automatically adjust when you're away.</li>
                                <li><strong>Use natural light:</strong> Open curtains during the day instead of using
                                    artificial lighting. Arrange workspaces near windows.</li>
                                <li><strong>Air-dry clothes:</strong> Skip the dryer when possible. Air-drying saves
                                    energy and extends clothing life.</li>
                                <li><strong>Regular maintenance:</strong> Clean air filters monthly, seal window drafts,
                                    and insulate your home to reduce heating/cooling needs by up to 30%.</li>

                                    per year. Check toilets by adding food coloring to the tank‚Äîif it appears in the

                                <li><strong>Install low-flow fixtures:</strong> Low-flow showerheads (2.0 GPM or less)
                                    and faucet aerators can reduce water use by 30-50% without noticeable pressure loss.

                                <li><strong>Shorter showers:</strong> Reduce shower time by just 2 minutes to save up to
                                    10 gallons per shower. Consider a shower timer.</li>
                                <li><strong>Full loads only:</strong> Run dishwashers and washing machines only when
                                    full. Modern dishwashers actually use less water than hand washing.</li>
                                <li><strong>Collect rainwater:</strong> Install rain barrels to collect water for
                                    gardening and outdoor cleaning. A single barrel can save 1,300 gallons during peak
                                    summer.</li>
                                <li><strong>Water plants wisely:</strong> Water early morning or evening to minimize
                                    evaporation. Use drip irrigation for gardens.</li>

                                <li><strong>Reduce single-use plastics:</strong> Carry reusable bags, water bottles,
                                    coffee cups, and food containers. One reusable bag can eliminate 1,000 plastic bags
                                    over its lifetime.</li>
                                <li><strong>Compost organic waste:</strong> Food scraps and yard waste make up 30% of
                                    household trash. Composting creates nutrient-rich soil and diverts waste from
                                    landfills.</li>
                                <li><strong>Recycle correctly:</strong> Learn your local recycling rules. Rinse
                                    containers, remove lids, and never bag recyclables. Contamination can ruin entire
                                    batches.</li>
                                <li><strong>Buy in bulk:</strong> Purchase items in larger quantities to reduce
                                    packaging waste. Bring your own containers to bulk stores.</li>
                                <li><strong>Repair before replacing:</strong> Fix broken items instead of discarding
                                    them. Look for repair cafes or learn basic repairs online.</li>
                                <li><strong>Donate and buy secondhand:</strong> Give usable items a second life through
                                    donation. Shop thrift stores, swap meets, or online marketplaces.</li>

                                <li><strong>Choose eco-friendly brands:</strong> Look for biodegradable, phosphate-free,

                                <li><strong>Use microfiber cloths:</strong> They clean effectively with just water,

                                <li><strong>Avoid antibacterial products:</strong> Regular soap and water are sufficient
                                    for most cleaning. Antibacterial chemicals can harm aquatic ecosystems.</li>
                                <li><strong>Make your own air fresheners:</strong> Use essential oils, simmer cinnamon

                                <li><strong>Choose plant-based proteins:</strong> Incorporate beans, lentils, tofu,
                                    tempeh, and nuts. They're nutritious, affordable, and environmentally friendly.</li>

                                <li><strong>Support organic farming:</strong> Organic practices avoid synthetic
